Hi, I noticed recently that Lucky patcher doesn't want to patch apps anymore anyone have a solution ?
:)have xposed on android N now?:confused:
We don't know the ETA of next Xposed -- if it's in more than half a year, I'd probably move to Magisk.﻿ We don't have access to the latest source code of Xposed (in development) -- if we have, I (also many people) would probably try to help. ﻿ :(:(
This might be a crazy question but I am contemplating it getting away from using Xposed. I love this app and I love the ability it gives me to tweak TouchWiz and I was wondering how this app is performing the tweaks. Is it done through XML editing? Is it something that a reasonably bright person could do, albeit in an extremely painstaking time I imagine lol? Thanks for any points in the right direction I know this is sort of off topic but I appreciate it thank you
I believe that the corrupter in disguise is the lastest google play service version which some what manage to apprehend xposed installer uses of root permission even though the phone has been rooted. ﻿ ﻿ I have tried many possible way to fix it but still no success such as re-rooting my samsung s5 phone. ﻿ ﻿ The xposed installer log report also says that the firefds files is not exist in the system directory even though upon lurking through file explorer the file does exist!﻿ ﻿ Its affecting other xposed apps such as youtube adway. Same thing happened to XtouchWiz.﻿ ﻿ That evil nasty google play service also without any permission, deleted my beloved fifa14 apps with reason the apps might damaging my device.﻿ ﻿ I tried uninstall google play service but other apps wouldn't function properly. I tried to lower the google play service version to an old one but it later able to update itself and some apps even ask to update the lastest version. At the moment I just disable storage permission in hoping it doesn't delete my fifa14 again.  ﻿ ﻿ Edited - nope. Still ****ing deleted my fifa14 arghh dem you google play service!!﻿ 
Wat about the battery dev , did u increase it  , did u grant our wish ,

Yesterday i migrated from cm 13 to cm14.1 (galaxy a500fu) and i tried to login to Snapchat before rooting the phone as i usually didon cm13, but is not working. I rooted it then full unruted from super su, tried root switcher also, none of those worked. So i guess the cm14.1 came with xposed preinstalled(is that possible?). I searched for the uninstalled for 7.1 version but i only found for 6.1 and lower. Will it work if i install one of those lower zips?
Is there a ROM that turns android to iOS?
Anyone else have this problem ? I have some headaches and burning during calls (SD 625 version)

is it a rom or a theme?
Yeah yeah i know it but i have a disorder called obsessive compulsive disorder. That is even if i disable it my brain itself doesn't accept the fact that I myself disabled it. Thus i ask developers to remove this feature completely once and for all.
I am also trying to find out a way to completely disable it but no joy till yet, hopefully someone might build a app to do that, cheers.
I'm afraid that does not turn PP off. It only limits its snooping to Play Store apps. Who knows what else it is doing.Basic point: you cannot uninstall, delete, remove, completely stop PP. It (Google) owns your phone.
One day, one guys say to me "I use CrDroid on my Mi Mix".... I say: "Are you crazy??? ONLY RR if you want the best at all!!!"But as usual i try all version, because i want to speak about all real experience.I installed first time for 5 minutes, and mi Mi Mix was so fast that i say "woow" and an incredible personalization. But the last release of RR was waiting me.... After two days that i continue to think about the speed of Mix with CrDroid, i decide to install another time with all the applications and settings....
